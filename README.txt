This script smooths out the differences between the various browser
implementations of the HTML5 Drag and Drop Module.  It currently works with
Firefox 3.5+, Chrome 3.0+, Safari 3.0+ and Internet Explorer 5.0 (Note: that
is not a typo -- HTML5 Drag and Drop is based on work done by Microsoft in
1999). 

Note that this script is *not* a polyfill (yet ... as of Jan. 2013, Opera still
does not support HTML5 Drag and Drop).
